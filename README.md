# To do:
**Add multiple logos to cycle through with space bar**  
-newly added logos should also cycle to the next logo  
-the file names for the images are all like dvd1.png, dvd2.png, etc  
-images 1-5 exist now, but i will add more in the future, so make it expandable  

**Add speed features**  
-each new image should have a random speed  
-create a place for me to define the speed range that will be assigned out  

**Color Cycle**  
-Make it so the color of the image cycles through all colors  
-Will a png work? Does it need to be svg?  
-it should change the color of the image, not the background of the image.  
-the image background should stay transparent if it is already transparent.
